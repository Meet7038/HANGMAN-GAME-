a) Introduction:

This code is for a Hangman game created with Python using the tkinter library. The player guesses a word by suggesting one letter at a time. If the letter is correct, it appears in the word, if not, the player loses a chance. The game ends when the player either guesses the word or runs out of chances. After the game ends, the player can click "Play Again" to start a new game.




b) Problem Domain:

#The problem domain for this code is creating a word guessing game (Hangman). The main challenges include:
1. Word Selection:
   Choosing a random word for the player to guess.
2. Guess Management:
   Allowing the player to guess one letter at a time and tracking the guesses made.
3. Game Logic:
   Checking if the guessed letter is in the word, updating the word display, and reducing the number of chances if the guess is wrong.
4. User Interface:
   Displaying the guessed word, chances left, and feedback messages through a graphical interface using tkinter.
5. Game Flow:
   Managing the game’s progress, handling win/loss conditions, and allowing the player to reset and start a new game.




c) Expected Output/Solution Domain:

#The expected output of the Hangman game is as follows:
1. Word Display:
   -Initially, the word is displayed with underscores (e.g., _ _ _ _ _ for a word like "apple").
   -As the player guesses correct letters, those letters will replace the underscores in the correct positions (e.g., a _ _ a _ after guessing 'a').
2. Chances Left:
   -The number of remaining chances will be shown (e.g., "Chances Left: 7").
   -This count decreases each time the player makes an incorrect guess.
3. Feedback Messages:
   -If the player guesses a correct letter, a message like "Correct! Keep going!" will be displayed.
   -If the letter is wrong, a message like "'x' is not in the word. Try again!" will appear.
   -When the player guesses all the letters correctly, a "Congratulations! You won!" message is shown.
   -If the player runs out of chances, a "Game Over! The word was 'xyz'" message appears.
4.Game End:
  -Once the game is over, either by winning or losing, a "Play Again" button will appear, allowing the player to start a new game with a different word.

#Solution Domain:
1. The game allows the player to interact with the system via a simple graphical interface.
2. The solution should ensure smooth gameplay, providing real-time updates on the guessed word, feedback, and chances left.
3. The player should be able to make guesses, get immediate feedback, and see the game’s progress.
4. At the end of the game, the solution should offer the option to restart and play again.




d) Requirements,Data Structures And Software:

#Requirements:
1. Data Structures: List, Set, Dictionary, Deque, StringVar.
2. Software: Python 3.13.1, tkinter library, random module.
3. System: Python 3.13.1 installation and tkinter library.

#Data Structure:
1. List: guessed_word — Holds the current state of the word with blanks and correct guesses.
2. Set: guessed_letters — Tracks the letters that the player has already guessed.
3. Dictionary: letter_positions — Maps each letter to its positions in the word.
4. Deque: guess_history — Stores the last 10 guesses made by the player.
5. StringVar: display_var, chances_var, message_var — Dynamically updates text on the GUI.

#Software:
1. Python 3.13.1
2. Tkiker Library




e) Methodology:

1. Initialize the game by selecting a random word and setting up necessary variables.
2. Allow player interaction via text input and button clicks to make guesses.
3. Process guesses to check if they are correct or incorrect, updating the display and chances.
4. Handle win/loss conditions, displaying feedback and ending the game.
5. Provide a reset option to start a new game when the current one ends.
